            <p class="introduction-text">Let me introduce myself, my name is Andr√©s Valencia, I'm from    Colombia and I'm a Telemathic Engineer from ICESI University. I started engaging with the <strong>frontend development</strong> in 2017 on the last semesters of my career. Learning the basics of <strong>HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> and after that began learning <strong>React.js</strong> for some projects. Later I discover the <strong>Angular Framework</strong><i> (In that time was Angular 5 near to upgrade to Angular 6).</i> And there is when my path as a Frontend Developer started.</p>
